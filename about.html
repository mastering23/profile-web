        <h2>My Markup Drawing & Design Process</h2>
      
        <p>Before writing any code, I start by sketching out the basic structure of the website. Here's how I approached it:</p>
     
      <span>

        <ol>
          <li>Home Page: I began by outlining the layout of the homepage, defining the key sections and features I wanted to include.</li>
          <li>About Page: Next, I drew the design for the About page, focusing on how to present the tools and techniques I used in an engaging way.</li>
          <li>Profile Page: After that, I planned out the Profile page, mapping out how to display information about myself in a clear and organized manner.</li>
        </ol>
      
      </span>
      
      <span>

    </article>

      <article class="boxes-about-pg">
        
        <strong><p>After the main pages were sketched, I moved on to add key elements like:</p></strong>
        
        <span>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Menu: A navigation bar that helps users easily move between the homepage, about page, and profile.</li>
            <li>Footers: Important links and information placed at the bottom of every page to keep the website connected and consistent.</li>
            <li>images: adding images that help to create more visualization to Webpages</li>
          </ul>
        
        </span>
        
        <p>Through this process, I ensure every element is thoughtfully placed and serves a purpose, making the website easy to navigate and user-friendly.</p>
        <p>the mockups were done using <strong>excalidraw website</strong>

        <h2>To bring this website to life, I rely on a set of powerful tools:</h2>
      
       <ul>
        
        <li>VS Code: My go-to code editor, where I write and manage all the code for this project.</li>
        <li>Git Bash: I use this terminal tool for pushing, merging, and running various commands to manage my project seamlessly.</li>
        <li>GitHub: A platform that not only helps me develop my code but also allows me to share my projects with the world.</li>
       
      </ul>
       
       <p>These tools work together to help me build, manage, and share everything you see here!</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML forms the backbone of the website
             by structuring the content. It defines elements like headings,
             paragraphs, images, and links,
             ensuring everything is organized and accessible on the webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style and visually design the
            website. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall
            appearance, making the webpage look appealing and user-friendly.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Together, HTML builds the foundation of the site, and CSS adds the visual aesthetics, ensuring the website is both functional and attractive.</p>
