# 🌐 Profile Webpages Project

Welcome to the **Profile Webpages Project**! 🚀

In this project, I designed a website named **Profile Webpages**. It includes a simple yet engaging layout where you can showcase your personal profile or any type of information you'd like to present. This project allowed me to work with **HTML**, **CSS**, and a small **JavaScript** feature to enhance the user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structured the elements of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styled the elements, making the page visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Added a basic `Hello World` alert to demonstrate interaction.

## 📋 Features

- **HTML**: Worked with various elements to build the webpage layout, such as headers, paragraphs, and images.
- **CSS**: Applied styles to enhance the page's look and feel, including fonts, colors, and layouts.
- **Images**: Incorporated images to make the profile more visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Added a simple `Hello World` alert for fun!
